# Kinesis

### Kinesis Data Streams

`Kinesis Data Streams` enables you to build custom applications that process or analyze streaming data for specialized needs.

### Kinesis Data Analytics (SQL Queries against streaming data)
`Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics` is the easiest way to `process and analyze real-time, streaming data`. Kinesis Data Analytics `can use standard SQL queries` to process Kinesis data streams and can ingest data from Kinesis Streams and Kinesis Firehose but Firehose cannot be used for running `SQL queries`.
