#  AWS Lambda

### Monitoring
AWS Lambda automatically monitors functions on your behalf, reporting metrics through Amazon CloudWatch. These metrics include total invocation requests, latency, and error rates. The throttles, Dead Letter Queues errors and Iterator age for stream-based invocations are also monitored.

You can monitor metrics for Lambda and view logs by using the Lambda console, the CloudWatch console, the AWS CLI, or the CloudWatch API.
