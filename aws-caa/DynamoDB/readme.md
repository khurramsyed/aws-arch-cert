# Dynamo DB


## Durability
- Dynamo DB is `replicated across multiple AZs`.

DynamoDB tables are `schemaless, except for the primary key`, so the items in a table can all have different attributes, sizes, and data types.

### Charges
- Charged for provisioning read and write capacity and the storage of data within DynamoDB
- **`NOT charged`** for the transfer of data into DynamoDB, providing you stay within a single region (if you cross regions, you will be charged at both ends of the transfer.


### DynamoDB Streams

Amazon DynamoDB is integrated with AWS Lambda so that you can create triggersâ€”pieces of code that automatically respond to events in DynamoDB Streams. With triggers, you can build applications that react to data modifications in DynamoDB tables.

If you enable **`DynamoDB Streams`** on a table, you can associate the stream ARN with a Lambda function that you write. Immediately after an item in the table is modified, a new record appears in the table's stream. AWS Lambda polls the stream and invokes your Lambda function synchronously when it detects new stream records.

You can create a Lambda function which can perform a specific action that you specify, such as sending a notification or initiating a workflow. For instance, you can set up a Lambda function to simply copy each stream record to persistent storage, such as EFS or S3, to create a permanent audit trail of write activity in your table.
