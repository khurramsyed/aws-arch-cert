### Access Logging
Server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. Server access logs are useful for many applications. For example, access log information can be useful in security and access audits. It can also help you learn about your customer base and understand your Amazon S3 bill.

Each access log record provides details about a single access request, such as:
- The requester
- bucket name
- request time
- request action
- response status


### Storage Classes
There are six S3 storage classes.

- S3 Standard (`durable`, `immediately available`, `frequently accessed`).
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering (`automatically moves data to the most cost-effective tier`).
- S3 Standard-IA (`durable`, `immediately available`, infrequently accessed).
- S3 One Zone-IA (`lower cost` for infrequently accessed data with `less resilience`).
S3 Glacier (archived data, `retrieval times in minutes or hours`).
S3 Glacier Deep Archive (`lowest cost storage class for long term retention`).

### S3 Notifications

**S3 notifications Can be sent to SQS queue, a lambda or SNS**

## Data Protection

Data protection refers to protecting data while in-transit (as it travels to and from Amazon S3) and at rest (while it is stored on disks in Amazon S3 data centers). You can protect data in transit by using SSL or by using client-side encryption. You have the following options for protecting data at rest in Amazon S3:
- Server Side Encryption (SSE)
- Client Side Encryption (CSE)

### Use Server-Side Encryption
 You request Amazon S3 to encrypt your object before saving it on disks in its data centers and decrypt it when you download the objects.

- Use Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
- Use Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS)
- Use Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)

### Use Client-Side Encryption
 You can encrypt data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. In this case, you manage the encryption process, the encryption keys, and related tools.

- Use Client-Side Encryption with AWS KMS–Managed Customer Master Key (CMK)
- Use Client-Side Encryption Using a Client-Side Master Key

#### Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)

When you use Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3):
-  each object is encrypted with a `unique key`.
- As an `additional safeguard`, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates.
- Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data

#### Server-Side Encryption with Customer Master Keys (CMKs) Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)

- similar to SSE-S3, but with some `additional benefits` and `charges` for using this service.
- There are separate permissions for the use of a CMK that provides added protection against unauthorized access of your objects in Amazon S3.
-  SSE-KMS also provides you with an `audit trail` that shows when your CMK was used and by whom.
- Additionally, you can create and manage customer managed CMKs or use AWS managed CMKs that are `unique to you, your service, and your Region`.

#### Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)

- Customer manages the `encryption keys` and
- Amazon S3 manages the `encryption`, as it writes to disks, and `decryption`, when you access your objects.


### Proivisioned Capcity and Expedited retrieval

**Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required**. For all but the largest archives (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals are typically `made available within 1–5 minutes`. `Provisioned Capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it.`

To make an Expedited, Standard, or Bulk retrieval, set the Tier parameter in the Initiate Job (POST jobs) REST API request to the option you want, or the equivalent in the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs. If you have purchased provisioned capacity, then all expedited retrievals are automatically served through your provisioned capacity.

Provisioned capacity ensures that your retrieval capacity for expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Each unit of capacity provides that at least three expedited retrievals can be performed every five minutes and provides up to 150 MB/s of retrieval throughput. You should purchase provisioned retrieval capacity if your workload requires highly reliable and predictable access to a subset of your data in minutes. Without provisioned capacity Expedited retrievals are accepted, except for rare situations of unusually high demand. However, if you require access to Expedited retrievals under all circumstances, you must purchase provisioned retrieval capacity.


### S3 Limits

- Largest object that can be uploaded in a **`single PUT`** is 5 GB and not 5 TB.
- Remember that the upload limit depends on whether you upload an object using a `single PUT` operation or via `Multipart Upload`.
- **`The largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 GB`**. Please take note the phrase **`"... in a single PUT"`**.
- If you are using the **`multipart upload API, then the limit is 5 TB`**.
